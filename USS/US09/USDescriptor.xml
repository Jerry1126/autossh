	<Description><![CDATA[RB meta removal Requriement
		Adaptation: onePM
		Requirement description:
		Remove RB meta for newly developed OnePM Adaptation
		AoA metadata functionality should be retained
		pm&pd relevant tables/views for transcient objects should be retained for
		adaptation support, onePM reporter tool . (Notice: if pm&pd
		tables/views missing, the adaptation support tool will execute
		unsuccessfully! )
		Add individual RB meta installation control
		Solution:
		configure RB support to '0' in koala general configuration file
		As 'EnableRBSupport' is 0, the pm&pd tables/views for transcient objects
		can't be generated by koala either. This will impact adaptation
		support tool of onePM.

		So koala should be changed for the above reason.
		change koala for the pm&pd tables relevant files generation
		change koala for pm&pd talbes relevant cron jobs in
		installation/uninstallation scripts
		Add a new attribut for xxxxxGeneralConfiguration.cf, called
		EnableASSupport, to control the generation of pm&pd tables/views files
		and installation/uninstallation scripts individually
		Create pm&pd synonyms based on the GIMMap relationship for ITK
		Add a new attribut for xxxxxGeneralConfiguration.cf, called
		EnableRBInstall, to control the RB meta installation]]></Description>
