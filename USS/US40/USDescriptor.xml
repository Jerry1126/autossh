	<Description><![CDATA[ADescription:
		Currently KOARTE/CCKOALA generates the content to model file without
		considering converting the special characters: "&", ">", "<", "'",
		""". These characters should be converted as it's in xml structure
		thus ITK/DA/extension adaptation can correctly read and parse it.

		Solution:
		Add the convertion for these chars during outputing the contents to model
		file.
